slugid-go provides:

* A go (golang) module for generating v4 UUIDs and encoding them into 22
character URL-safe base64 slug representation (see [RFC 4648 sec.
5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)).
* A command line tool to provides the same functions

Slugs are url-safe base64 encoded v4 uuids, stripped of base64 `=` padding.

There are two methods for generating slugs - `slugid.V4()` and
`slugid.Nice()`.

* The `slugid.V4()` method returns a slug from a randomly generated v4 uuid.
* The `slugid.Nice()` method returns a v4 slug which conforms to a set of
  "nice" properties. At the moment the only "nice" property is that the slug
  starts with `[A-Za-f]`, which in turn implies that the first (most
  significant) bit of its associated uuid is set to 0.

The purpose of the `slugid.Nice()` method is to support having slugids which
can be used in more contexts safely. Regular slugids can safely be used in
urls, and for example in AMQP routing keys. However, slugs beginning with `-`
may cause problems when used as command line parameters.

In contrast, slugids generated by the `slugid.Nice()` method can safely be
used as command line parameters. This comes at a cost to entropy (121 bits vs
122 bits for regular v4 slugs).

Slug consumers should consider carefully which of these two slug generation
methods to call. Is it more important to have maximum entropy, or to have
slugids that do not need special treatment when used as command line
parameters? This is especially important if you are providing a service which
supplies slugs to unexpecting tool developers downstream, who may not realise
the risks of using your regular v4 slugs as command line parameters, especially
since this would arise only as an intermittent issue (one time in 64).

Generated slugs take the form `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22}`, or more precisely:

* `slugid.V4()` slugs conform to
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8}[Q-T][A-Za-z0-9_-][CGKOSWaeimquy26-][A-Za-z0-9_-]{10}[AQgw]`

* `slugid.Nice()` slugs conform to
  `[A-Za-f][A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}[Q-T][A-Za-z0-9_-][CGKOSWaeimquy26-][A-Za-z0-9_-]{10}[AQgw]`

RFC 4122 defines the setting of 6 bits of the v4 UUID which implies v4 slugs
provide 128 - 6 = 122 bits entropy. Due to the (un)setting of the first bit
of "nice" slugs, nice slugs provide therefore 121 bits entropy.


Go library usage
----------------

```go
import "github.com/taskcluster/slugid-go/slugid"

...

// Generate "nice" URL-safe base64 encoded UUID version 4 (random)
slug := slugid.Nice()  // a8_YezW8T7e1jLxG7evy-A

// Alternative, if slugs will not be used as command line parameters
slug := slugid.V4()    // -9OpXaCORAaFh4sJRk7PUA

// Get [UUID](https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid#UUID) from slug
uuid := slugid.Decode(slug)

// Get slug from [UUID](https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid#UUID)
slug := slugid.Encode(uuid)
```

Command line usage
------------------

To install:

```
go get github.com/taskcluster/slug-go/slug
```

This will create the "slug" command line client. To use, make sure
`${GOPATH}/bin` is in your path, and run `slug --help`:


```
Usage:
  slug [-n|--nice|-r|--v4] [COUNT]
  slug encode [UUID...|-]
  slug decode [SLUGID...|-]
  slug -h|--help
  slug -v|--version

  slug [-n|--nice|-r|--v4] [COUNT]  Generates new slug(s). If -r or --v4 is
                                    provided, regular v4 UUID are used for
                                    generating the slug(s). In all other cases
                                    (-n, --nice, or *no* option) "nice" slugs
                                    are generated. COUNT specifies how many
                                    slugs to generate, default is one. Slugs
                                    are output on separate lines.

  slug decode (-|[SLUGID...])       Outputs the v4 UUID(s) represented by the
                                    given SLUGID(s), or slugid(s) passed via
                                    standard in (one per line) if '-' is
                                    provided. UUID(s) are output one per line,
                                    in the order they were specified. If no
                                    slugids are provided as command line options
                                    or via '-' option, slug generates no output
                                    and exits successfully.

  slug encode (-|[UUID...])         Outputs the SLUGID(s) represented by the
                                    given UUID(s), or UUID(s) passed via
                                    standard in (one per line) if '-' is
                                    provided. SLUGIDs are output one per line,
                                    in the order they were specified. If no
                                    UUIDs are provided as command line options
                                    or via '-' option, slug generates no output
                                    and exits successfully.

  slug -h|--help                    Displays this help page.

  slug -v|--version                 Displays the version of the slug command
                                    line tool.


Return Codes:

   0: Success
   1: Unrecognised command line options
  64: Cannot decode invalid slug into a UUID
  65: Problem reading standard input during slug decoding
  66: Cannot encode invalid uuid into a slug
  67: Problem reading standard input during slug encoding
  68: Invalid value passed in for command line option COUNT
```

RNG Characteristics
-------------------
UUID generation is performed by the
[code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid](https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid)
library which in turn uses the
[crypto/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/#pkg-variables) standard
library for generating entropy. This library declares:

> Reader is a global, shared instance of a cryptographically strong
> pseudo-random generator.
>
> On Unix-like systems, Reader reads from /dev/urandom. On Linux, Reader uses
> getrandom(2) if available, /dev/urandom otherwise. On Windows systems, Reader
> uses the CryptGenRandom API. 

The slugid library inherits these RNG characteristics.
